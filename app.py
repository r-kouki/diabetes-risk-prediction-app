        st.markdown("""
        This tool uses machine learning to estimate your risk of developing diabetes based on various health and lifestyle factors.
        
        #### How it Works
        The prediction model was trained on health survey data to identify patterns associated with diabetes risk. The app:
        1. Collects your health information through the questionnaire
        2. Processes this information using our trained machine learning model
        3. Calculates a personalized risk score based on your specific health profile
        4. Provides recommendations based on that score
        
        #### Key Risk Factors
        The model considers these important factors in diabetes risk prediction:
        
        **Personal Factors**
        - **Age**: Risk increases significantly after age 45, and approximately doubles for each decade thereafter
        - **BMI/Weight**: One of the strongest predictors; BMI over 30 increases risk by 7x compared to normal weight
        - **Income Level**: Affects access to healthcare, nutritious food, and safe exercise environments
        
        **Health History Factors**
        - **General Health Status**: Self-reported health strongly correlates with actual health outcomes
        - **Cardiovascular Conditions**: Heart disease, stroke, and diabetes share many underlying risk factors
        - **Kidney Disease**: Has a bidirectional relationship with diabetes and shares metabolic pathways
        - **Mental Health**: Depression and chronic stress affect hormones that regulate blood glucose
        
        **Lifestyle Factors**
        - **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can reduce diabetes risk by 30-50%
        - **Smoking**: Increases risk by 30-40% through inflammation and direct damage to pancreatic cells
        - **Alcohol Consumption**: Moderate consumption may be protective, while heavy drinking increases risk
        
        #### Understanding Your Results
        Your risk score is calculated based on the complex interaction of all these factors:
        
        <div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <h5>Interpreting Your Score</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Below threshold</strong>: Your current risk factors suggest a lower likelihood of developing diabetes compared to the general population</li>
            <li><strong>Above threshold</strong>: Your combination of risk factors indicates a higher likelihood of developing diabetes</li>
            <li><strong>Score magnitude</strong>: Higher percentages indicate stronger evidence of risk based on your profile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember that this is a statistical prediction based on population data, not a medical diagnosis.</p>
        </div>
        
        #### Limitations
        This tool has several important limitations to keep in mind:
        - It relies on self-reported information which may not be completely accurate
        - It cannot replace laboratory tests such as blood glucose measurements
        - It doesn't account for family history of diabetes, which is a significant risk factor
        - Genetic factors that influence diabetes risk are not captured
        - The model provides population-level estimates, not individualized biological assessments
        
        Always consult with healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment decisions.

            Our model weighs different factors based on their predictive power for diabetes risk:
            
            **Very High Impact Factors**
            - **BMI/Weight Status**: Obesity (BMI>30) can increase risk by 7-fold compared to normal weight
            - **Age**: Risk approximately doubles for every decade after age 40
            - **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can reduce risk by 30-50% by improving insulin sensitivity
            - **Overall Health**: Self-reported "poor" health indicates a 2-3x higher risk
            
            **High Impact Factors**
            - **Cardiovascular Disease**: Heart conditions often share metabolic risk factors with diabetes
            - **High Blood Pressure**: Hypertension increases diabetes risk by 60%
            - **Kidney Disease**: Has a bidirectional relationship with diabetes risk
            - **Smoking**: Daily smoking increases risk by 30-40%
            
            **Moderate Impact Factors**
            - **Mental Health**: Depression increases risk by 37-60%
            - **Alcohol Consumption**: Heavy drinking increases risk while moderate consumption may be protective
            - **Income Level**: Lower income correlates with limited access to healthcare and nutrition
            - **Cancer History**: Some treatments and inflammatory states affect glucose metabolism
            
            Different combinations of these factors create your unique risk profile. The model integrates these 
            factors using complex mathematical relationships to generate your personalized risk score.
            
            **Important Note**: Modifiable factors like weight, exercise, smoking, and diet present opportunities 
            to significantly reduce your diabetes risk through lifestyle changes.

            - F1 Score: 45.4% (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
            - AUC-ROC: 0.73 (model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases)
            
            **Feature Engineering**:
            - Age-BMI interaction effects are captured with compound features
            - Input standardization ensures consistent scaling across all features
            - Missing value imputation uses state-of-the-art methods

            selected based on their known association with diabetes risk from medical literature and feature
            importance analysis from machine learning algorithms.
